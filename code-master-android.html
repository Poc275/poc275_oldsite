                    <h2 class="space">Code Master Android Application</h2>

                    <p class="space">The application is a remake of the old board game Mastermind where the object of the game is to crack a coloured code within an allotted number of attempts. 
                        Feedback pegs indicate how close you are to a correct guess after each turn. If you have an Android powered phone 
                        <a href="http://market.android.com/details?id=com.pete.assignment.codemaster">download Code Master from Google Play</a> and try it out.</p>

                    <p class="space">This project provided a different type of challenge because of the hardware limitations inherent in mobile devices. Due to the multi-tasking nature 
                        of a mobile device, many applications will be running at any one time, meaning memory is at a premium. This warranted a judicious use of new objects to minimise 
                        time spent garbage collecting, member variables were accessed directly instead of via getters and setters to speed things up, and static classes were favoured 
                        over non-static to save on memory.</p>

                    <p class="space">One of the most important optimisations was the use of threads. The main thread drives the user interface loop, so if this is affected by slow 
                        performance the user receives a not responding warning. This acute lack of responsiveness is particularly evident on touch screen devices where users expect a much 
                        faster response to interactions than with a traditional mouse. Therefore any work that is potentially time consuming is fired off onto a child thread, 
                        keeping the user interface responsive.</p>
