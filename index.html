                <h2>This site came about as I was struggling to rewrite my CV. I had just completed my BSc in Computer Science with the aspiration of moving into software development. 
                    I was trying to tailor the CV to highlight some of my software projects. Then I had a thought, instead of trying to describe what I’ve done, why not show it? 
                    Not a particularly ground breaking eureka moment, designers always showcase their work, so programmers must as well. Only, I couldn’t find many programming portfolios 
                    on the web. This seemed strange as a portfolio is an excellent domain to showcase your work that you cannot convey succinctly in a standard CV.</h2>
                <h3 class="space">This site is a response to this issue. It is a portfolio of my programming projects to date. You can look through a <a href="complete-portfolio.html">complete 
                    list of my work</a>, or to read my favourite projects, keep scrolling.</h3>

                <h1>Data visualisation user controls</h1>
                <p class="space">This was my final year dissertation project. I was keen to study this area of computing as it became apparent during my studies that data processing 
                    is one of the most important challenges that lie ahead. Without resorting to hackneyed slogans, data is now being produced at exponential rates thanks 
                    to huge investment in sensing, simulating, and communication technologies. Couple this with a decrease in storage costs and you end up with a situation 
                    where our ability to collect data has outstripped our ability to process it. Data visualisation (the graphical representation of data) is an important 
                    tool which can help redress  the balance.</p>
                            
                <p class="space">My research uncovered a situation where the disparate disciplines involved in the field of data visualisation were operating in apparent isolation. 
                    This enables the creation of inaccurate data visualisations, which is surprisingly evident in software. The lack of collaboration allows the conventional 
                    rules to be broken because ultimately, developers of data visualisation software were not aware of the founding principles.</p>
                            
                <p class="space">This results in a ‘gap’ in current work where the wisdom of each discipline needs combining as a whole. Data visualisation user controls were created to fill 
                    this gap. User controls enable programmers to create visualisations that enforce the accepted wisdom of the field, without them having to be experts. 
                    This also redresses the balance between the widely available tools that target data visualisation experts who may not have any programming experience, and 
                    the lack of tools that target the reverse.</p>

                <p class="space">The controls implement the research findings through a sample set of visualisation techniques specifically chosen as they are suited to larger datasets 
                    that are now so common, and they also enable interactivity, which is a vital aspect when trying to make useful data discoveries:</p>

                            <span class="data-vis-descriptions">A treemap visualises data through the use of rectangles. The area of the rectangle is 
                                the encoding feature, which can also contain further nested rectangles to depict a hierarchy.</span>

                            <span class="data-vis-descriptions">Parallel coordinates use parallel axes for each data dimension. Then for each unit of data, a 
                                line is drawn from left to right, moving up or down depending on the values at each axis.</span></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>

                            <span class="data-vis-descriptions">Graduated symbol maps encode geographic data through the use of glyphs. A glyph is placed 
                                on the map and sized according to certain variables. The glyphs can be simple shapes, or more complex depending on the amount of variables.</span>

                        <td>

                <p class="clear space">The Windows runtime (WinRT) was chosen as the target environment, although this is arbitrary as the controls have been 
                    built up using standard controls that are widely available in other environments. The full dissertation has been published in the

                    <h1>C++ 3D Software Renderer</h1>
                    <p class="space">This project provided an appreciation of how 3D graphics APIs such as DirectX and OpenGL work under the covers. To do this, a software renderer (written in C++) was 
                        built up from scratch. The following concepts were covered:</p>
                    <ul>
		                <li>Geometric Transformations – how to get from model co-ordinates to screen co-ordinates a.k.a. the viewing pipeline</li>
		                <li>Vector maths – calculating vectors from points, vector addition, vector length, dot product and cross product</li>
		                <li>Lighting – ambient, directional, point and spot lighting</li>
		                <li>Reflection – Diffuse and specular (Phong/Blinn-Phong reflection models)</li>
		                <li>Rasterisation – Gouraud shading</li>
		                <li>Texturing</li>
                        <li>Cameras &amp; Viewpoints – the view frustum, polygon culling and clipping</li>
	                </ul>
	
                    <p class="space">The evolution of Marvin image demonstrates the progression of the renderer. It starts with a simple wireframe, progressing to flat shaded 
                        polygons (using GDI+), and ending with a custom Gouraud shader to smooth out the image. Lighting effects are then applied to modulate the overall appearance, 
                        and finally the model is textured. The full evolution can be seen in the video along with an explanation of what is being demonstrated at each stage.</p>

	                <p class="space">This was probably the most challenging project I have worked on to date, but ultimately it proved very rewarding as some really nice effects can be achieved. I really enjoyed 
                        the modular nature of how the project was built up, with a study of a particular algorithm, followed by its implementation. This allowed the application to be built up gradually, 
                        preventing it from becoming too overwhelming.</p>

                    <h1>Street Sounds</h1>
                    <p class="space">This was an exciting project as it gave me the chance to develop for the latest Windows 8 operating system. The brief was just to create something ‘cool’ 
                        (leaving just enough rope to hang myself with). Looking back, this proved to be an excellent form of motivation. Definitive briefs can often stifle innovation 
                        as you simply work through each requirement. I found that with a looser set of requirements I was more inclined to keep adding functionality as there 
                        was just enough doubt there as to what constituted a good application.</p>
                            
                    <p class="space">As music is one of my passions, I was interested in creating a music based application. Couple this with one of <a href="https://soundcloud.com">my favourite 
                        music sites</a> and we have a good starting point. One of my first ideas was for a way of people to find information about street musicians that they come across. 
                        This required some form of geo-location functionality which was provided by Bing Maps.</p>
                            
                    <p class="space">One of the projects long running issues was the lack of attributes that the musicians apply to their music. Tracks uploaded to SoundCloud have many useful 
                        fields to fill in, unfortunately they are not mandatory and many are free-entry fields, which give a disparate range of search results when you try and query 
                        for such things as street musicians.</p>

                    <p class="space">The lack of street musicians on SoundCloud resulted in the project evolving into a broader music discovery application whilst still retaining the location 
                        functionality. Users can browse for sounds near their current location, from a random point on the map, from a specific city, or they can just view the most 
                        popular, or most recent tracks on SoundCloud and see where on the map they are from.</p>
                            
                    <p class="space">From a programming perspective, the built-in Visual Studio templates made sticking to the Windows Store design philosophy straight-forward. The majority of the 
                        work was spent creating the data model, this made data-binding to the template controls relatively simple. The application is written in C#/XAML and utilises
                        the Model-View-View Model (MVVM) pattern.</p>

                    <p class="space">The application passed the Windows Certification Test but unfortunately it will not be appearing in the Windows Store due to changes in the SoundCloud 
                        API that now cause the geo-tagging features to be ignored. This proved to be a valuable lesson in using third party APIs! However 
                        <a href="https://github.com/Poc275/StreetSounds">I’ve made the code available</a> as it may still prove useful to anyone interested in developing 
                        Windows Store Apps using the SoundCloud API.</p>
