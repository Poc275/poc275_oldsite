                    <h2 class="space">Distributed Application Development</h2>

                    <p class="space">The aim of this project was twofold: firstly to develop an understanding of the technological foundations in distributed systems, and 
                        secondly, to develop expertise in designing and developing robust and scalable distributed systems.</p>

                    <p class="space">The project brief was to design, develop and deploy a Facebook-like application using App Engine. The application had the following requirements:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Friends in a network should be able to share resources (photographs, web pages, videos etc.).</li>
                        <li>The application should be able to find friends in networks and make friend recommendations.</li>
                        <li>Friends in a network should be able to like/unlike their own and friend’s resources.</li>
                        <li>A ‘preferential search’ mechanism is required where the most popular resources appear at the top of search results.</li>
                        <li>The social network needs to be visualised.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="space">The project required a lot of up-front research and design. We chose the Java runtime environment for App Engine as this is the language that the 
                        group was most comfortable with. Programming for App Engine was very different to what we had been used to, particularly when it came to creating the back-end database. 
                        Traditional relational databases do not scale well, so a NoSQL approach was used. This incurred a steep learning curve.</p>

                    <p class="space">To achieve scalability and robustness we decided to let existing services do the heavy work for us. This resulted in us using YouTube to provide the 
                        videos, Gmail to provide friend requests/recommendations, we looked at the possibility of using Flickr for the photos, but a suitable ‘in-house’ images API proved to 
                        be more suitable as it linked very easily within App Engine.</p>

                    <p class="space">We had to design algorithms to make credible friend recommendations and to rank the popularity of shared resources. By importing a user’s Gmail 
                        contacts (this could be done easily as users login into the application with their Gmail credentials), we could provide a basic but effective friend of friends 
                        algorithm. More complex recommendations were researched, such as content matching, where people who have liked/disliked similar resources are recommended to each 
                        other. However, this algorithm required extra meta-data that wasn’t available to us from the APIs we were utilising. For the popularity ranking we used an age of 
                        vote algorithm that aimed to be more useful than a simple ordering of likes versus dislikes. The age of the vote was important to take into account to ensure the 
                        rankings were relevant in terms of what is currently popular. This was programmed using a cron job which updated a ranking score for each resource at regular intervals.</p>

                    <p class="space">The project was very challenging but it felt extremely relevant in today’s world of computing where sites such as Facebook and Twitter are ubiquitous. It 
                        did feel we were only scratching the surface of what is required in a true distributed application. I would personally have liked to study more complex algorithms, which 
                        may have led onto a MapReduce style of computation for scalability. I would have also liked to investigate latency issues to test how the application would respond to 
                        heavy traffic.</p>
