                    <h2 class="space">The design and implementation of a swimming pool booking &amp; timetable application</h2>

                    <p class="space">The swimming pool has various sessions throughout the day, some are open to the general public, while others are open only to members. This 
                        required two sub-systems, one to manage the memberships and one to record the session bookings. This broader brief meant that more consideration had to go 
                        into the design of the application. Coding immediately at the beginning, only to resort to major changes later when problems were envisaged was not an option.</p>

                    <p class="space">The brief was examined for nouns that were of importance, these formed the classes of the application. A class diagram was created using 
                        <abbr title="unified modelling language">UML</abbr>. The design was refined over time by using techniques such as use-case scenarios to ensure all of the classes were identified. 
                        The diagram was created using <a href="http://www.sparxsystems.com/products/ea/">Enterprise Architect</a>, so when the diagram was complete, the skeleton code could 
                        be automatically generated.</p>

                    <p class="space">One of the requirements of the application was that bookings could be taken concurrently. Multi-threading and modeless dialog boxes were used to enable 
                        multiple booking forms to be open at the same time. This also required the use of mutexes to lock the bookings timetable whilst it was being updated.</p>

                    <p class="space">This project made me realise how important the design stage is in programming a new application. The temptation is to start coding immediately but the constant 
                        modifications to the class diagram highlighted that this would have been a flawed approach. The study of the brief to examine nouns, mixed with use-case scenarios really 
                        helped to identify the classes and methods that the system would require. Multi-threading proved to be a challenge, particularly when it came to ensuring shared resources 
                        were locked. It was crucial that activities were locked when a thread was booking to them to prevent over-subscription. This required a lot of testing to try and find all 
                        of the possible race conditions.</p>
