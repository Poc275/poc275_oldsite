                    <h2 class="space">The design and implementation of my own programming language - Frooble</h2>

                    <p class="space">Frooble is an imperative language with functional programming features. It is a high level, verbose, general programming language that aims to 
                        be easy to learn. Syntactically and semantically it is very similar to Java and C#. All basic data types are supported: integers, floats, strings, bools and 
                        arrays. Object orientation is supported with class based inheritance. Static scoping is supported allowing local and global variables. Control flow is provided 
                        by while loops and for loops. Decisions are supported through if/else statements. Code reuse is allowed via functions, which also return values. Frooble programs 
                        are read ahead so functions can be called before they are defined, C like prototypes are therefore not required. Functions can also be stored as variables and 
                        executed later as per first-order functions, which is common in the functional programming paradigm.</p>

                    <h3>Frooble hello world:</h3>
                    <pre class="prettyprint">
                        <code>
print "Hello World"
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    <p class="space">I wanted Frooble to be able to communicate easily with the outside world, any useful programming language does not exist in isolation. Frooble 
                        can communicate with C/C++ through the <abbr title="Java Native Interface">JNI</abbr>, allowing easy access to an already available standard library. Frooble 
                        can export symbols for use in other languages, for example the Python interpreter can be embedded, or a C program can read exported Frooble symbols. This is achieved 
                        via memory mapped files, so any language with support for reading file mappings can integrate with Frooble. A web data type is also available for consuming web APIs. 
                        This data type takes a URL that returns JSON data. This data is then bound to a Frooble class which can be easily accessed to retrieve the data. The aim of this data type 
                        was to abstract out a lot of the hard work involved in consuming web APIs.</p>

                    <h3>Frooble web data type:</h3>
                    <pre class="prettyprint">
                        <code>
string city = "Derby"

web weather = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=" + city + ",uk&units=metric"

print "The weather in " + city + " is " + weather.description + " with a temperature of " + weather.temp + " degrees celsius"
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    <p class="space">The actual implementation is an interpreter written in Java using the <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR4 parser generator</a>. ANTLR removes a lot of the 
                        hard work involved in parsing source code, leaving a nice syntax tree to work with. For appreciation a small part of the language was implemented as a 
                        compiler targeting the virtual architecture <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a>.</p>

                    <p class="space">This project, although a challenge, was very rewarding. It completed a lot of gaps in my knowledge in terms of how programming languages have evolved and 
                        why there are so many of them. In the early years of learning to program you are never really told why languages are constructed how they are. It is not until you try 
                        and create your own that you can get an appreciation for the myriad factors that are involved. The overall lesson from this work was that there isn’t really any 
                        sort of ‘magic’ happening, there are just lower levels of detail.</p>
