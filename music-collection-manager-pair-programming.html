                    <h2 class="space">Music collection manager</h2>

                    <p class="space">Up until this point projects had been individual efforts, unfortunately this isn’t realistic. In the real world programs are in written in groups 
                        using different methodologies. The methodology used in this project was extreme programming, which involves teams of equal partners (developers, managers and customers) 
                        ensuring focus isn’t lost. This is coupled with shorter release times to get input at more regular intervals.</p>

                    <p class="space">As part of the extreme programming methodology, pair programming was used for the actual development. The idea behind pair programming is to have two 
                        programmers working at a single machine, one is the driver, who is actually writing the code, and the other is the observer, who is watching, checking for errors 
                        and keeping the work on track. After a certain amount of time, the roles are reversed. As per the extreme programming methodology, the goal is to get constant feedback, 
                        ironing out problems at the earliest possible stage.</p>

                    <p class="space">The application is a Windows forms program that manages a music collection. Conventional albums as well as compilation albums are supported 
                        (through the use of inheritance). Users can search for albums or individual tracks. The collection is stored in a file using serialisation.</p>

                    <p class="space">We found that pair programming requires the right kind of people to work effectively. Ideally people with good social skills will be better suited to this 
                        kind of approach. This is because a good working relationship needs to be formed so each person feels free to point out problems and suggest solutions, whilst at the 
                        same time not becoming a ‘backseat driver’, interrupting every time a slight error/typo is spotted. We also found that getting programmers of equal ability and experience 
                        would be beneficial, otherwise the relationship can degrade into a mentor-student approach where a less experienced programmer simply watches what the senior programmer 
                        is doing, which defeats the object.</p>

                    <p class="space">By the end of the project we could see the advantages of such an approach, bugs were discovered earlier, unit tests could be written by one person and coded 
                        by another and we managed to pass on a lot of knowledge to each other. However we already knew each other quite well, so we felt comfortable working together, other teams 
                        might not have this luxury, which could lead to problems.</p>
