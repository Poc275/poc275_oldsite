                    <h2 class="space">Multi-user database system for an online shoe store</h2>

                    <p class="space">The first step was to identify the entities, relationships and attributes by analysing the project brief. The entities are the things of significance 
                        about which information needs to be known, such as shoes, customers and orders. Relationships explain how the entities are related (one to one, one to many), and 
                        the attributes contain specific information about the entities, such as shoe types, gender and payment method. The result of this is a conceptual entity relationship 
                        diagram, which is a sort of first attempt at modelling the database. </p>

                    <p class="space">The next step is to break down any many to many relationships as these cannot be represented by a relational database. The conceptual diagram had a many 
                        to many relationship between ‘order’ and ‘stock’ i.e. each stock item may be bought via one or many order/s, and each order must be issued for one or many item/s of 
                        stock. A weak entity called ‘order detail’ was created to break this relationship down. Now each order must contain one or many order detail/s, and each order detail 
                        must relate to only one order (a one to many relationship). Each stock item may be bought via one or many order detail/s, and each order detail must order only one 
                        stock item (also a one to many relationship). This is depicted in the logical entity relationship diagram.</p>

                    <p class="space">The normalisation process was next. This is required to minimise data redundancy which causes integrity problems. Update and delete transactions may not 
                        be consistently applied to all copies of the data causing inconsistencies. Normalisation was carried out up to <abbr title="Third Normal Form">3NF</abbr>. 
                        This helped identify three more entities that were previously missed. A data dictionary was then produced to identify all of the data types for the attributes. The 
                        model was now in a suitable state for it to be created in an actual DBMS. MySQL was chosen for this as it is a widely used and readily available DBMS. The physical 
                        entity relationship model depicts the MySQL database.</p>

                    <p class="space">A front end was then created using PHP to test the database. To accomplish this a navigation map was produced by applying use case scenarios to the system 
                        to identify all of the pages that are required, which tables and attributes are required, whether the page is static or dynamic, public or private, and if the page 
                        requires read or write permissions on the database. The idea is that a front end developer can pick this up and have an immediate overview of how to put the site 
                        together. It is also often shown to business managers for approval.</p>

                    <p class="space">A second version of the system was created using SQL Server and ASP.Net. This combination of open source and proprietary systems provided a broad appreciation 
                        of the available <abbr title="Database Management Systems">DBMS</abbr> that exist in the industry.</p>
